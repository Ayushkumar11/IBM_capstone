Introduction:**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toranto.\n\nLots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n\nThis Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.

Venue Latitude\n7. Venue Longitude\n8. Venue Category"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**4. Conclusion Section**\n\nIn this project, using k-means cluster algorithm I separated the neighborhood into 10(Ten) different clusters and for 103 different lattitude and logitude from dataset, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. Using the charts above results presented to a particular neighborhood based on average house prices and school rating have been made.\n\nI feel rewarded with the efforts and believe this course with all the topics covered is well worthy of appreciation. This project has shown me a practical application to resolve a real situation that has impacting personal and financial impact using Data Science tools. The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence.\n\n**Future Works:**\nThis project can be continued for making it more precise in terms to find best house in Scarborough. Best means on the basis of all required things(daily needs or things we need to live a better life) around and also in terms of cost effective.\n\nLibraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\nPandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n\nFolium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n\nScikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n\nJSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n\nXML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n\nGeocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n\nBeautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n\nMatplotlib: Python Plotting Module."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
